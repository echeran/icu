### üî¥üî¥üî¥ Do you need ICU to work on EBCDIC platforms? üî¥üî¥üî¥

*   ICU4C used to work on IBM mainframes (OS/390, z/OS) and other native-EBCDIC
    platforms (OS/400, i5/OS, IBM i).
*   This has not been tested since [ICU 59](../download/59.md) moved to C++11
    (2017). Apparently there are now C++11 compilers available for one or both
    of these platforms.
*   **We need help**: Someone needs to build ICU4C on such a machine, fix C++
    compiler issues (if any), fix issues related to an EBCDIC codepage as the
    system encoding, and test frequently (or add their machine into our CI). We
    will assist you, especially with EBCDIC-specific character and string
    handling.
*   **Otherwise we will remove the support code for non-ASCII-family
    platforms.**
    ([ICU-21672](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-21672))
*   Please contact us via the [icu-support mailing

Special Notice About Branch Renaming: On 2021-March-24 we renamed the `master`
branch to `main` branch (<https://github.com/github/renaming>).

If you have a local git clone of the repo, you need to rename your default
branch:

```
$ git branch -m master main
```

```
$ git fetch origin
```

```
$ git branch -u origin/main main
```

If you use the master branch in your personal fork on GitHub, rename that branch
to main as well. (If you go to your fork, GitHub should show you a pop-up dialog
with a link to the settings.)

2021-03-18: [ICU 69.1](../download/69.md) released. It updates to CLDR 39. This
release includes significant improvements for measurement unit formatting and
number formatting in general.

2020-12-17: [ICU 68.2](../download/68.md) released. It updates to CLDR 38. New
features including locale-dependent smart unit preferences (road distance,
temperature, etc.) and locale ID canonicalization conformant with CLDR. (ICU 68
was released on 2020-10-28. Maintenance release 68.2 includes some bug fixes.)

2020-04-22: [ICU 67](../download/67.md)
[released](http://blog.unicode.org/2020/04/icu-67-released.html). It updates to
Unicode 13 & CLDR 37. Bug fixes for date and number formatting, enhanced support
for user preferences in the locale identifier. LocaleMatcher code and data
improved. Number skeletons have a new ‚Äúconcise‚Äù form that can be used in
MessageFormat strings.

2020-03-11: [ICU 66](../download/66.md) released. It updates to Unicode 13 &
CLDR 36.1. New, extra Q1 releases for low-risk integration of Unicode 13.

## What is ICU?

ICU is a mature, widely used set of C/C++ and Java libraries providing Unicode
and Globalization support for software applications. ICU is widely portable and
gives applications the same results on all platforms and between C/C++ and Java
software.

ICU is released under a nonrestrictive [open source
license](http://www.unicode.org/copyright.html#License) that is suitable for use
with both commercial software and with other open source or free software.

Here are a few highlights of the services provided by ICU:

*   Code Page Conversion: Convert text data to or from Unicode and nearly any
    other character set or encoding. ICU's conversion tables are based on
    charset data collected by IBM over the course of many decades, and is the
    most complete available anywhere.
*   Collation: Compare strings according to the conventions and standards of a
    particular language, region or country. ICU's collation is based on the
    Unicode Collation Algorithm plus locale-specific comparison rules from the
    [Common Locale Data Repository](http://www.unicode.org/cldr/), a
    comprehensive source for this type of data.
*   Formatting: Format numbers, dates, times and currency amounts according the
    conventions of a chosen locale. This includes translating month and day
    names into the selected language, choosing appropriate abbreviations,
    ordering fields correctly, etc. This data also comes from the Common Locale
    Data Repository.
*   Time Calculations: Multiple types of calendars are provided beyond the
    traditional Gregorian calendar. A thorough set of timezone calculation APIs
    are provided.
*   Unicode Support: ICU closely tracks the Unicode standard, providing easy
    access to all of the many Unicode character properties, Unicode
    Normalization, Case Folding and other fundamental operations as specified by
    the [Unicode Standard](http://www.unicode.org/).
*   Regular Expression: ICU's regular expressions fully support Unicode while
    providing very competitive performance.
*   Bidi: support for handling text containing a mixture of left to right
    (English) and right to left (Arabic or Hebrew) data.
*   Text Boundaries: Locate the positions of words, sentences, paragraphs within
    a range of text, or identify locations that would be suitable for line
    wrapping when displaying the text.

And much more. Refer to the [ICU User Guide](http://userguide.icu-project.org/)
for details.

## Why Unicode?

Unicode (and the parallel ISO 10646 standard) defines the character set
necessary for efficiently processing text in any language and for maintaining
text data integrity. In addition to global character coverage, the Unicode
standard is unique among character set standards because it also defines data
and algorithms for efficient and consistent text processing. This simplifies
high-level processing and ensures that all conformant software produces the same
results. The widespread adoption of Unicode over the last decade made text data
truly portable and formed a cornerstone of the Internet.

*   [What is Unicode?](http://www.unicode.org/standard/WhatIsUnicode.html)

Globalized software, based on Unicode, maximizes market reach and minimizes
cost. Globalized software is built and installed once and yet handles text for
and from users worldwide and accomodates their cultural conventions. It
minimizes cost by eliminating per-language builds, installations, and
maintenance updates.

## Why ICU4C?

The C and C++ languages and many operating system environments do not provide
full support for Unicode and standards-compliant text handling services. Even
though some platforms do provide good Unicode text handling services, portable
application code can not make use of them. The ICU4C libraries fills in this
gap. ICU4C provides an open, flexible, portable foundation for applications to
use for their software globalization requirements. ICU4C closely tracks industry
standards, including Unicode and CLDR (Common Locale Data Repository).

## Why ICU4J?

Java provides a very strong foundation for global programs, and IBM and the ICU
team played a key role in providing globalization technology into Sun's Java.
But because of its long release schedule, Java cannot always keep up-to-date
with evolving standards. The ICU team continues to extend Java's Unicode and
internationalization support, focusing on improving performance, keeping current
with the Unicode standard, and providing richer APIs, while remaining as
compatible as possible with the original Java text and internationalization API
design.

## ICU4JNI

New versions of ICU4JNI are no longer being created. If you need the
functionality of ICU4JNI, you should consider migrating to ICU4J.
