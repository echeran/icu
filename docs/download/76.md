# ICU 76

ICU is the [premier library for software internationalization](https://icu.unicode.org/#h.i33fakvpjb7o),
used by a [wide array of companies and organizations](https://icu.unicode.org/#h.f9qwubthqabj).

## Release Overview

ICU 76 updates to
[Unicode 16](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode16.0.0/)
([blog](https://blog.unicode.org/2024/09/announcing-unicode-standard-version-160.html)),
including new characters and scripts, emoji, collation & IDNA changes, and corresponding APIs and implementations.
It also updates to
[CLDR 46](https://cldr.unicode.org/downloads/cldr-46)
([beta blog](https://blog.unicode.org/2024/09/unicode-cldr-46-beta-available-for.html))
locale data with new locales and various additions and corrections.

There are some new APIs to make ICU easier to use with modern C++ and Java patterns.

The Java and C++ technology preview implementations of the (also in [tech preview](https://github.com/unicode-org/message-format-wg?tab=readme-ov-file#messageformat-2-technical-preview)) CLDR MessageFormat 2.0 specification have been updated to match recent changes.

For more details, including migration issues, see below.

Please use the [icu-support mailing list](https://icu.unicode.org/contacts) and/or [find/submit error reports](https://icu.unicode.org/bugs).

### Version Number

## Common Changes

* [Unicode 16](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode16.0.0/)
  ([blog](https://blog.unicode.org/2024/09/announcing-unicode-standard-version-160.html)):
  * Adds five modern-use scripts: Garay, Gurung Khema, Kirat Rai, Ol Onal, Sunuwar
  * Adds two historic scripts & almost 4000 additional Egyptian Hieroglyphs
  * Seven new emoji characters
  * Over 700 symbols from legacy computing environments
  * ICU line breaking improvements have been upstreamed into
    [UAX #14](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/tr14-53.html#Modifications)
  * New UCD property Modifier_Combining_Mark for
    [UAX #53](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr53/) Arabic Mark Rendering
  * [IDNA](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr46/tr46-33.html#Modifications):
    The handling of UseSTD3ASCIIRules was simplified.
    Some existing characters changed from disallowed (when that was only for compatibility with
    long-obsolete IDNA2003) to valid.
* [CLDR 46](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/main/docs/site/downloads/cldr-46.md)
  ([beta blog](https://blog.unicode.org/2024/09/unicode-cldr-46-beta-available-for.html)):
  * Significant data updates across all locales
  * Locales which are now at modern coverage level: Nigerian Pidgin, Tigrinya
  * Locales which are now at moderate coverage level:
    Akan, Baluchi (Latin), Kangri, Tajik, Tatar, Wolof
  * New measurement units "night" and "light-speed"
  * Note: ICU 76 does not yet support `portion-per-1e9` (aka per-billion). (See [ICU-22781](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-22781))
  * [MessageFormat 2.0 tech preview updates](https://cldr.unicode.org/downloads/cldr-46#message-format-specification)
  * Language matching: Dropped the fallback mapping
    desired="uk" → supported="ru"
    (so that Ukrainian (uk) doesn’t fall back to Russian (ru))
  * [Collation](https://cldr.unicode.org/downloads/cldr-46#collation-data-changes):
    Significant changes to the CLDR root collation (CLDR default sort order)
    * Realigned With DUCET:
      The order of groups of characters which sort below letters is now the same.
      In both sort orders, non-decimal-digit numeric characters now sort after decimal digits,
      and the CLDR root collation no longer tailors any currency symbols
      (making some of them sort like letter sequences, as in the DUCET).
      _These changes eliminate sort order differences among almost all
      regular characters between the CLDR root collation and the DUCET._
    * Improved Han Radical-Stroke Order:
      The CLDR radical-stroke order now matches that of the Unicode Radical-Stroke Index;
      traditional vs. simplified forms of radicals are now distinguished on a lower level than the number of residual strokes.
      In alphabetic indexes for radical-stroke sort orders,
      only the traditional forms of radicals are now available as index characters.
* New Unicode properties APIs for Modifier_Combining_Mark and TODO
* Time zone data (tzdata) version 2024b (2024-sep). Note that pre-1970 data for a number of time zones has been removed, as has been the case in the upstream [tzdata](https://www.iana.org/time-zones) release since 2021b.
  * The Asia/Almaty time zone has become an alias following IANA TZ database changes.
  * CLDR added support for deprecated timezone codes by remapping:
    CST6CDT → America/Chicago, EST → America/Panama, EST5EDT → America/New_York,
    MST7MDT → America/Denver, PST8PDT → America/Los_Angeles
    (These IANA TZ changes were motivated by CLDR, see
    [CLDR-17111](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/CLDR-17111))

## ICU4C Specific Changes

* [API changes since ICU4C 75 (Markdown)](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/maint/maint-76/icu4c/APIChangeReport.md) / [(HTML)](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/maint/maint-76/icu4c/APIChangeReport.html)  
  * TODO: new stuff
  * Note: Some APIs were changed to accept a wider range of input types than before,
    but in the API change report they look like the old, stable signatures are removed,
    and like the wider signatures are added as “born stable”.
    For example, several UnicodeString constructors that take a raw pointer
    have been replaced with a signature that accepts such raw pointers but also additional input types.
  * Note: Similarly, the API change report appears to show removal+addition of
    certain UnicodeString::remove() and UnicodeString::removeBetween() overloads,
    but only the _expression_ of one of their default parameter values has changed.
  * TODO: below is from 75
  * MessageFormat 2.0 tech preview new API ([ICU-22261](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-22261))  
  * C: Require C11 (up from C99)  
  * C++: Require C++17 (up from C++11)  
  * Many changes for more robust string and buffer handling.

## ICU4J Specific Changes

* [API Changes since ICU4J 75](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/maint/maint-76/icu4j/APIChangeReport.html)  
  * TODO: new stuff
  * TODO: below is from 75
  * MessageFormat 2.0 tech preview update ([ICU-22690](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-22690))  
  * Performance (multi-threading / lock contention) improvement for BreakIterator.clone() and ULocale.getDefault(). ([ICU-22582](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-22582))

## Known Issues

* None yet

## Migration Issues

### IDNA Default Option Changed to Nontransitional Processing
After all major browsers have switched to nontransitional processing,
Unicode 15.1 (a year ago) changed the [UTS #46 spec](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr46/#Processing)
to declare transitional processing deprecated.

ICU 76 changes the "DEFAULT" API constants from 0 to UIDNA_NONTRANSITIONAL_TO_ASCII | UIDNA_NONTRANSITIONAL_TO_UNICODE.

ICU 76 does not change the behavior of using options value 0.
(That would change the behavior of existing binaries linking with new ICU libraries.)
However, when code is recompiled against a new version of ICU,
and when it uses the DEFAULT constant, then it will pass these option flags into the factory method.

* In C/C++: unicode/uidna.h [UIDNA_DEFAULT](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/dev/icu4c/uidna_8h.html#a726ca809ffd3d67ab4b8476646f26635aa1eb63014cdaf41c7ea6cf3abecf1169)
* In Java: IDNA.java [DEFAULT](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/dev/icu4j/com/ibm/icu/text/IDNA.html#DEFAULT)

See [ICU-22294](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-22294)

### SimpleNumber::truncateStart() Removed
ICU 75 renamed the still-draft SimpleNumber::truncateStart() to setMaximumIntegerDigits().
ICU 76 removes the never-stable, original function.
Same for the C API usnum_truncateStart().
([ICU-22900](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-22900))

### C++ Header-Only APIs
ICU 76 is the first version where we add what we call C++ header-only APIs.
These are especially intended for users who rely on only binary stable DLL/library exports of C APIs
(C++ APIs cannot be binary stable).

_Please test these new APIs and let us know if you find problems —
especially if you find a platform/compiler/options combination
where the call site does end up calling into ICU DLL/library exports._

Remember that regular C++ APIs can be hidden by callers defining `U_SHOW_CPLUSPLUS_API=0`.
The new header-only APIs can be separately enabled via `U_SHOW_CPLUSPLUS_HEADER_API=1`.

([GitHub query for `U_SHOW_CPLUSPLUS_HEADER_API` in public header files](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aunicode-org%2Ficu+U_SHOW_CPLUSPLUS_HEADER_API+path%3Aunicode%2F*.h&type=code))

These are C++ definitions that are not exported by the ICU DLLs/libraries,
are thus inlined into the calling code,
and which may call ICU C APIs but not into ICU non-header-only C++ APIs.

The header-only APIs are defined in a nested `header` namespace.
If entry point renaming is turned off (the main namespace is `icu` rather than `icu_76` etc.),
then the new `U_HEADER_ONLY_NAMESPACE` is `icu::header`.

([Link to the API proposal which introduced this concept](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xERVccTYsptzjfbjcj6HDtoKVF_mEKmslPsOiQzzaFg/view#heading=h.cf4bmhjgozry))

For example, for iterating over the code point ranges in a `USet` (excluding the strings):

```c++
U_NAMESPACE_USE
using U_HEADER_NESTED_NAMESPACE::USetRanges;
LocalUSetPointer uset(uset_openPattern(u"[abcçカ🚴]", -1, &errorCode));
for (auto [start, end] : USetRanges(uset.getAlias())) {
    printf("uset.range U+%04lx..U+%04lx\n", (long)start, (long)end);
}
for (auto range : USetRanges(uset.getAlias())) {
    for (UChar32 c : range) {
        printf("uset.range.c U+%04lx\n", (long)c);
    }
}
```

(Implementation note: On most platforms, when compiling ICU itself,
the `U_HEADER_ONLY_NAMESPACE` is `icu::internal`,
so that any such symbols that get exported differ from the ones that calling code sees.
On Windows, where DLL exports are explicit,
the namespace is always the same, but these header-only APIs are not marked for export.)

### Migration Issues Related to CLDR
* See [CLDR 46 migration issues](https://cldr.unicode.org/downloads/cldr-46#migration)
  * TODO: new stuff
  * TODO: below is from 75
  * ICU4C behavior for ill-formed locale IDs/language tags: uloc_getName(), uloc_getLanguage() and similar functions (and functions that rely on them) may fail with a U_ILLEGAL_ARGUMENT_ERROR when they used to fail only with a U_BUFFER_OVERFLOW_ERROR. (due to changes for [ICU-22520](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-22520))  
  * On Linux, the configure script now defaults to "cc" rather than preferring "clang". If you want to choose clang, then configure for "Linux/clang". ([ICU-22556](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-22556))

## ICU4C Platform Support

ICU4C requires C++17 and has been tested with up to C++20.

We routinely test on recent versions of Linux, macOS, and Windows.

We accept patches for other platforms.

For ICU 76, we have received a contribution to make ICU4C work again on z/OS,
using a newer (clang-based) compiler. ([ICU-22714](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-22714) [icu/pull/3008](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/pull/3008) + [ICU-22916](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-22916) [icu/pull/3208](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/pull/3208))

Windows: The minimum supported version is Windows 7. (See [How To Build And Install On Windows](../userguide/icu4c/build.html#how-to-build-and-install-on-windows) for more details.)

## ICU4J Platform Support

ICU4J works on Java 8..21 (at least).

ICU4J should work on Android API level 21 and later but may require “[library desugaring](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support#library-desugaring)”.
